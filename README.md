# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Project

## 🔹 Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate core functionalities of Airbnb, including user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. It aims to give learners real-world experience in backend architecture, API development, and scalable database design.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Implement a secure user authentication and management system.
- Create, update, and manage property listings and bookings.
- Integrate payment and review systems.
- Optimize database performance for scalability.
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub workflows.


## 🛠 Technology Stack
The Airbnb Clone Project uses a modern and scalable technology stack to ensure performance, security, and flexibility.
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API and managing the backend logic.

Django REST Framework (DRF): Provides powerful tools for creating and managing API endpoints.

PostgreSQL: A reliable and scalable relational database for storing user, property, and booking data.

GraphQL: Enables flexible and efficient querying of data for frontend and backend communication.

Celery: Used for handling asynchronous background tasks such as notifications or payment processing.

Redis: Supports caching and session management to improve application performance.

Docker: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments using containerization.

GitHub Actions (CI/CD): Automates testing and deployment pipelines for continuous integration and delivery.
