## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

### **1. User Management**

This feature handles the registration, authentication, and profile management of both hosts and guests. Users can sign up, log in securely, and update their personal details, ensuring a personalized experience for every user.

### **2. Property Management**

Hosts can list new properties, upload images, set prices, and manage property availability. This feature ensures that property owners have full control over their listings and can easily update information to attract more guests.

### **3. Booking System**

Guests can search for available properties, select check-in and check-out dates, and make bookings seamlessly. The booking system ensures that properties cannot be double-booked and that all reservation details are accurately stored.

### **4. Payment Integration**

This feature handles all financial transactions securely. It allows guests to make payments online for their bookings and provides receipts or confirmations, ensuring a smooth and trustworthy payment experience.

### **5. Review and Rating System**

Guests can rate and review properties after their stay. This feature builds credibility within the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions based on previous user experiences.

### **6. Search and Filter**

The search functionality allows guests to find properties based on criteria such as location, price range, and amenities. Filtering ensures users can quickly locate listings that match their preferences, improving overall usability.

### **7. Admin Dashboard (Optional Advanced Feature)**

An administrative interface to monitor user activity, manage listings, and handle reported issues. This helps maintain platform quality, security, and compliance.


## 🔐 API Security

Ensuring the security of the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, transactions, and platform integrity. The following key security measures will be implemented in the Airbnb Clone project:

### **1. Authentication**

Authentication ensures that only verified users can access the system. We will use secure authentication methods (such as JWT — JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identities during login.
✅ *Importance:* Protects the platform from unauthorized access and keeps user accounts safe.

### **2. Authorization**

Authorization controls what actions authenticated users can perform based on their roles (e.g., host, guest, admin).
✅ *Importance:* Prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they don’t own — for example, one host cannot edit another host’s property.

### **3. Data Encryption**

Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (in the database).
✅ *Importance:* Prevents data leaks and protects user information from interception or unauthorized disclosure.

### **4. Rate Limiting**

Rate limiting will be used to restrict the number of API requests a user can make in a specific period.
✅ *Importance:* Prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the system.

### **5. Input Validation & Sanitization**

All user input will be validated and sanitized before processing.
✅ *Importance:* Prevents security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and data corruption.

### **6. Secure Payment Handling**

Payment APIs will be integrated using trusted third-party services (e.g., Stripe or PayPal), following PCI-DSS compliance standards.
✅ *Importance:* Ensures all financial transactions are secure and users’ payment information remains confidential.

### **7. Regular Security Updates & Monitoring**

The system will include logging, monitoring, and regular dependency updates to detect and fix vulnerabilities early.
✅ *Importance:* Maintains long-term system integrity and protects against emerging threats.


## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

The **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the Airbnb Clone application. It ensures that new updates are seamlessly integrated into the main codebase without breaking existing functionality.

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**

CI automatically tests and integrates code changes whenever developers push updates to the repository. This helps detect bugs early and maintain a stable codebase.

### **Continuous Deployment (CD)**

CD automates the deployment of tested code to production environments, ensuring that new features, bug fixes, and improvements are delivered quickly and reliably to users.

### **Importance of CI/CD**

* Reduces manual errors during deployment.
* Speeds up development and release cycles.
* Ensures consistent code quality through automated testing.
* Promotes team collaboration and faster feedback.

### **Tools Used**

* **GitHub Actions:** For automating testing, building, and deployment workflows directly from the repository.
* **Docker:** For containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across different environments.
* **AWS / Render / Heroku (Optional):** For hosting and deploying the application automatically.
